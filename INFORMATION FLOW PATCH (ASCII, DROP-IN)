========================================================
PATCH: INFORMATION FLOW + GOVERNANCE CORRECTIONS
Applies to:
- MASTER FRAMEWORK / SKELETON SPEC
- MASTER SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE SPEC
- SSOT CONVERSATIONAL SYSTEM (v0.1 conceptual)
========================================================

PATCH 1 — BUDGET CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL)
----------------------------------------
- Mechanics are NEVER limited, throttled, or budgeted.
- Mechanics may interact with the system 24/7 without restriction.
- ALL budget constraints apply ONLY to system-initiated external compute
  (paid / large-model / GPU / API calls).

Internal system operations are NOT budgeted:
- chat intake
- capture
- ingestion
- evaluation
- contradiction detection
- citation
- compilation
- internal CPU workers
- internal model usage

Budget exists solely to:
- prevent unnecessary external escalation
- control cost leakage
- force internal reasoning first

Replace any language implying “user budget” with:
  “external escalation budget only.”

--------------------------------------------------------

PATCH 2 — MULTI-TIER ESCALATION (REPLACES SIMPLE ESCALATION)
------------------------------------------------------------
Escalation is now explicitly tiered.

Tier 0 — Frontdesk (always-on)
- classification
- retrieval
- simple synthesis
- no deep reasoning

Tier 1 — Internal reasoning (always allowed)
- evaluator swarm (2–4)
- contradiction hunter
- citation maker
- compiler pre-checks
- local models only

Tier 2 — Internal burst escalation (NEW)
- system may spin up up to N (e.g., 8) ephemeral CPU worker VMs
- workers perform:
  - parallel analysis
  - hypothesis voting
  - enrichment of context
- goal: attempt resolution WITHOUT external paid models

Tier 3 — External escalation (budgeted)
- paid / GPU / API models
- receives:
  - Case File
  - Tier 1 outputs
  - Tier 2 findings
  - contradictions
  - uncertainty summary
- budget + consent gates apply here ONLY

--------------------------------------------------------

PATCH 3 — ASSET RESOLUTION (NEW REQUIRED BOT)
---------------------------------------------
Add a mandatory pre-pipeline step:

Asset Resolver Bot:
- normalizes messy mechanic references
- resolves aliases, nicknames, locations
- links to canonical asset IDs
- runs BEFORE Case File assembly

This bot:
- does NOT assert truth
- does NOT evaluate claims
- improves context quality

--------------------------------------------------------

PATCH 4 — MECHANIC VOTING MODEL (REVISED)
-----------------------------------------
Replace categorical voting with confidence scale.

Mechanic vote scale (1–5):
1 = Absolutely wrong
2 = Looks wrong
3 = Unsure / maybe
4 = Seems right
5 = Absolutely correct

Rules:
- mechanics may vote multiple times over time
- mechanics may revise votes later
- no penalty for being wrong
- votes are additive signal only

Votes influence:
- confidence
- review priority
- promotion eligibility

Votes never directly edit SSOT.

--------------------------------------------------------

PATCH 5 — AUTHORING LAYERS (EXPANDED)
------------------------------------
The “Author” role is now a family of SSOT-only derivation bots.

All authors:
- read ONLY SSOT
- never invent facts
- produce derived, human-readable material

Author personas:
1) Technical Manual Author
   - procedural, step-by-step documentation

2) Senior Operator Narrator
   - practical “how we actually run this”
   - captures operational wisdom grounded in SSOT

3) Data Watchdog / News Interpreter
   - flags anomalies
   - highlights misalignment (ops vs metrics vs management)
   - produces insight bulletins

4) Educator / Scientist
   - training material
   - theory of operation
   - college-level explanations
   - “fun fact of the day” allowed (SSOT-backed)

--------------------------------------------------------

PATCH 6 — OBISIDIAN OUTPUT (DUAL TRACK)
--------------------------------------
SSOT is published in two curated forms:

Track A — Full Desktop HTML
- exhaustive
- deeply linked
- complete reference

Track B — Curated Obsidian SSOT
- mobile-first
- concise
- polished narrative flow
- short attention span friendly
- selection and structure decided by Author

Obsidian is NOT a raw dump.
It is a curated manual.

--------------------------------------------------------

PATCH 7 — SSOT AUDITOR (NEW GOVERNANCE ROLE)
--------------------------------------------
Add a dedicated SSOT Auditor.

SSOT Auditor:
- monitors SSOT PRs and promotion events
- watches for drift, shortcuts, unjustified certainty
- enforces “compiled truth only” discipline

Auditor powers:
- flag
- block
- require explicit human override

Auditor cannot approve changes.

--------------------------------------------------------

PATCH 8 — GOVERNANCE VISIBILITY + MAINTAINER OVERRIDE
-----------------------------------------------------
All non-conversational decisions MUST produce
human-readable English logs:
- escalation decisions
- promotion events
- approvals/rejections
- budget blocks
- overrides

Maintainer privileges:
- default: talk to Coach only
- override: may directly consult Philosopher or Architect
  (advisory, logged, non-executing)
- all execution still flows through PRs

========================================================
END PATCH
