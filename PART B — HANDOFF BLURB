FUTILITY’S — SYSTEM HANDOFF SUMMARY

This repository defines Futility’s: a self-hosted, rollbackable system for
capturing messy human input, rigorously evaluating it, and publishing only
what survives contradiction, citation, and governance as Single Source of Truth (SSOT).

At its core:

- Conversation is NOT truth.
- Capture is NOT clean.
- Truth is COMPILED.
- SSOT is sacred.
- Rollback is mandatory.

Mechanics interact with a single chat interface, 24/7, without restriction.
They speak naturally. The system listens in two ways:
1) conversational helpfulness (explicitly untrusted)
2) structured capture (verbatim, unverified)

Behind the scenes, captured information flows through a back-office pipeline:
- ingestion
- parallel evaluation
- contradiction detection
- citation building
- compilation into proposed truth

Proposed truth is visible, reviewable, and voteable, but never authoritative by default.
SSOT publication occurs only through explicit gates:
- human approval
- manager approval
- or trusted mechanic quorum
Always with a PR, provenance, and audit trail.

The system escalates reasoning carefully:
- first using internal logic and models
- then internal burst compute (ephemeral workers)
- and only as a last resort using external paid models
Budgets apply ONLY to this final external escalation, never to mechanics.

SSOT outputs are published in multiple forms:
- a full HTML reference
- a curated Obsidian manual for mobile, quick use
- and a derived “book” authored entirely from SSOT

Governance is layered:
- Coach keeps direction and coherence
- Philosopher protects theory and intent
- Red Team challenges assumptions
- Auditor protects the sacred nature of SSOT
- Architect designs changes
- Code Manager executes, deploys, and rolls back

All changes flow through PRs.
All decisions are logged in human-readable English.
Nothing important happens silently.

This system exists to survive time, repetition, pressure, cost constraints,
and human imperfection—while still producing truth that can be trusted,
explained, and rolled back when wrong.
