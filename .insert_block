### Patch 001 — Add official patch process to MASTER (2026-02-02)

> Source: Issue #2

## Scope
doctrine

## Paste Block (what you want added/changed)

GOAL
Establish the official, canonical patch workflow for maintaining SSOT.

This patch documents how all future changes to MASTER must be proposed,
reviewed, audited, and merged using the automated patch system.

---

RATIONALE

Right now, ideas and refinements are scattered across multiple markdown files
and conversations. This causes drift, duplication, and ambiguity.

We are formalizing:

- No direct edits to MASTER
- All changes originate from Issues
- All changes are compiled via patches
- All changes are reviewable and reversible

This preserves long-term integrity.

---

PROCESS

1) All proposed changes begin as GitHub Issues.

2) Issues intended to modify SSOT must begin with:

   "Patch: <short description>"

3) The Issue body becomes raw intake.

4) Automation compiles intake into:

   - /patches/NNN-*.md
   - HISTORY.md
   - Inserted section in MASTER.md

5) A Pull Request is generated automatically.

6) Human review is required.

7) Only merged PRs affect SSOT.

---

RULES

- MASTER.md is never edited directly.
- Patches are append-only.
- HISTORY.md is immutable.
- Rollbacks are performed via revert commits.
- Conflicts are resolved via new patches, not rewrites.

---

STATUS

This patch establishes the baseline governance model.
All future governance changes must themselves be introduced via patches.
